# AI vs. Human Text Classification Project

-This project focuses on classifying essays generated by AI and those written by humans. The dataset consists of 500,000 essays obtained from Kaggle. The primary steps in the project include:

1- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2- Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to improve model performance.
3- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
4- Model Training and Testing: Implementing a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the target variable.
5- Results: Achieving an accuracy of 95% on the test set, with visualizations including a confusion matrix.
- The submission file contains IDs from the test set along with probabilities for the target variable. This project showcases effective techniques for text classification and can be a valuable resource for those interested in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
# Dataset:
This dataset consist of 500K essays both generated by AI and written by Human.
